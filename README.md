# Analyzing-Terrorism-Coverage-through-Topic-Modeling

This project analyzed how terrorist organizations are portrayed in traditional media outlets using topic modeling.
The dataset included articles from the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times that were collected in 2017. 
The corpus was preprocessed and exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the data. 
A topic model was then created using the cleaned corpus, and the results were compared and analyzed to identify the dominant themes present in the corpus. 
The analysis revealed that the media focuses on political violence, religious extremism, and the impact of terrorism on society.
This study highlights the power of topic modeling as a tool for understanding complex datasets and discovering latent topics within large corpora of text.
